My name is Edvinas Danevičius. I'm a developer who loves JVM and its ecosystem. I mostly write back-end applications with Java and or Kotlin. However from time to time I dip my nose into front-end and game development as well.

I like clean, structured and tested code. Static analysis and automation tools which help me to stay on this track are my best friends.
